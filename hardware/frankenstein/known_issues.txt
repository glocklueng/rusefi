1) hi-side driver: the part number is for SOIC package but the board has MSOP package. Part number should be TC4427AEUA
2) todo: add full 25x2 silkscreen on the back
3) todo: hi-side net names are weird: control line indeces do not match output line indeces
4) TODO: 5v power pin with a jumper - that's for a HD44780 so that power could be turned on/off
