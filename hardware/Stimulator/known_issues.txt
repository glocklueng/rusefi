1) silkscreen font is really small
2) TODO: add breakout holes for all unused pins to simplify CS routing
3) TODO: add 'Power' LED - for stimulator board power
4) add two MAX232 chips (four VR stimulation channels)
5) secondary power LED - this one would display the status of external +5 power source
