 * @section sec_scheduler Event Scheduler
 *
 * It is a general agreement to measure all angles in crankshaft angles. In a four stroke
 * engine, a full cycle consists of two revolutions of the crankshaft, so all the angles are
 * running between 0 and 720 degrees.
 *
 * Ignition timing is a great example of a process which highlights the need of a hybrid
 * approach to event scheduling.
 * The most important part of controlling ignition
 * is firing up the spark at the right moment - so, for this job we need 'angle-based' timing,
 * for example we would need to fire up the spark at 700 degrees. Before we can fire up the spark
 * at 700 degrees, we need to charge the ignition coil, for example this dwell time is 4ms - that
 * means we need to turn on the coil at '4 ms before 700 degrees'. Let's  assume that the engine is
 * current at 600 RPM - that means 360 degrees would take 100 ms so 4ms is 14.4 degrees at current RPM which
 * means we need to start charting the coil at 685.6 degrees.
 *
 * The position sensors at our disposal are not providing us the current position at any moment of time -
 * all we've got is a set of events which are happening at the knows positions. For instance, let's assume that
 * our sensor sends as an event at 0 degrees, at 90 degrees, at 600 degrees and and 690 degrees.
 *
 * So, for this particular sensor the most precise scheduling would be possible if we schedule coil charting
 * as '85.6 degrees after the 600 degrees position sensor event', and spark firing as
 * '10 degrees after the 690 position sensor event'
