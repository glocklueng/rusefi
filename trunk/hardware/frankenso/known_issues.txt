46) RESOLVED IN R0.3  Short out D10.
47) RESOLVED IN R0.4  add vias around ST processor. Orginal board design was a 2 layer, not it's 4 layer. It's better design practice to have GND via's closer to the GND pins.
48) RESOLVED IN R0.3  Per 32) and 33) change W64,63 change to single hole, which allows U chips to move away from enclosre metal wall
49)                   Make hidden text for component values align such that a picture can be caputured that displays the component values.

56) RESOLVED IN R0.4  Add Top, T-1, T-2 and T-3 to PCB copper layers to more clearly identify layers to MFG
57) RESOLVED IN R0.4  knock2 is actually knock0. Need to fix net names & the pinout picture
58) RESOLVED IN R0.4  Change C166 and C167 to 27pF instead of 20/18pF, to match XTAL specified 20CL. (30*30)/(30+30)+5= 20pF with 5pF stray capacitance.

67)                   JP04 & JP05 are defined on the main schematics sheet. It would be better to define then on Page 8 with the rest of cam/crank stuff
68) RESOLVED IN R0.4  Updated silk screen notes, draws .12 amps normal, with a typical inrush of .3A. 
69) RESOLVED IN R0.4  Look into LCD dimming R99, perhaps replace with a POT. Perhaps connect to a GPIO
70) RESOLVED IN R0.5 Clamp input voltage, as of R0.4 a surge will likely blow an upstream fuse. FIXED, ADDED Q1003 AND FRIENDS
71) RESOLVED IN R0.4  Some USB connectors are wider and hit the PCB making it hard to insert. MOVED PCB EDGE TO BE CLOSER TO USB CONNECTOR.
72) RESOLVED IN R0.4  TI TPIC8101 part number instead of HIP9011
73) RESOLVED IN R0.4  more holes for proto

79) RESOLVED IN R0.4  1K and 0R on the MAX9926 input: need to put a comment on the schematics page explaining that none or just one of them should be installed depending on the use-case SEE 65)
80) RESOLVED IN R0.4  on schematics, rename INJ_xx to LOW_xx? "inj" is a bit confusing, it implies that PE6 is injector #1 while it is usually not the case
81) RESOLVED IN R0.4  set analog input values to match https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LTvS7I-128Hft9uXHG1JrBxetVjGJDSBkySgVDQ6MGk/edit#gid=0

93)                    added pololu stepper driver Perhaps should be an add-on board. 
94) RESOLVED IN R0.4.2 C701, LD601, LD602, LD605, LD606 silk screen mangled. 
95) RESOLVED IN R0.4.2 D1001 doesn't have a polarity indicator in the silk screen
96)                   route unused stm32 pins (D3 PC13 etc) to unused connector pins
