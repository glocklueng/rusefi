 * @brief	Tuner Studio plain protocol implementation
 *
 *
 * Tuner Studio has a really simple protocol, a minimal implementation
 * capable of displaying current engine state on the gauges would
 * require only two commands: queryCommand and ochGetCommand
 *
 * queryCommand:
 * 		Communication initialization command. TunerStudio sends a single byte H
 * 		ECU response:
 * 			One of the known ECU id strings. We are using "MShift v0.01" id string.
 *
 * ochGetCommand:
 * 		Request for output channels state.TunerStudio sends a single byte O
 * 		ECU response:
 * 			A snapshot of output channels as described in [OutputChannels] section of the .ini file
 * 			The length of this block is 'ochBlockSize' property of the .ini file
 *
 * These two commands are enough to get working gauges. In order to start configuring the ECU using
 * tuner studio, three more commands should be implemented:
